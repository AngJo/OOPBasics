This is a paragraph that uses every single letter in the alphabet.
Now, that doesn’t mean this can be a paragraph with no story, but it does mean that every single letter is used. You can make it as generic or fanciful as you’d like.
You can talk about anything from quilts to jets to xylophones.
Oh yeah, and you can use whatever language you want, from Afrikaans to Zulu.
